    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Muffaddal Aquil. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
         Engineering (B.Tech). Immediately after graduating, I embarked on my professional journey by joining 
         a startup as a data analyst, where I've garnered four years of invaluable experience in this field.  
         Presently, I am enthusiastic about transitioning my career towards a more technical path, leveraging 
         my solid background in technology. To facilitate this shift, I recently completed a two-month course 
         in frontend development and discovered a profound interest in software development. 
          My natural curiosity is one of my strongest strengths, a optimistic outlook, 
          as well as a leadership quality. It's important to note that I have a loco motor disability,
           I am a left leg amputee. This aspect has never hindered my passion for learning and pursuing excellence in the technology.</p>
